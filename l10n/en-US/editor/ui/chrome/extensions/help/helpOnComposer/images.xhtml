Your Web Page</h2>

<h3 id="inserting_an_image_into_your_page">Inserting an Image into
Your Page</h3>

<p>You can insert GIF, JPEG, BMP, and PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
images into your web page. You can also use them to <a
href="#using_images_as_links">create links</a>. When you insert an
image, &brandShortName; saves a reference to the image in your
page.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to publish your pages to the
web, it's best not to use BMP images in your pages.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: It's best to first save or publish your page
before you insert images into it. This allows &brandShortName; to
automatically use relative references to images once you insert
them.</p>

<p>To insert an image:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the image
  to appear.</li>

  <li>Click the Image button <img src="images/image.png" width="26"
  height="26" alt="" /> on the toolbar, or open the Insert menu and
  choose Image. You see the Image Properties dialog box.</li>

  <li>Type the location and filename of the image file, or click Choose
  File to search for an image file on your hard drive or network.</li>

  <li>Type a simple description of your image as the alternate text that
  will appear in text-only browsers (as well as other browsers)
  when an image is loading or when image loading is disabled.

  <p>Alternatively, you can choose not to include alternate text.</p>
  </li>

  <li>If needed, click other tabs so you can adjust the settings (for
  example, alignment) in the <a href="#editing_image_properties">Image
Properties</a> dialog box.</li> </ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To quickly insert an image: Drag and drop it
onto your page.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To insert a line break after all images in a
paragraph, choose Break Below Images from the Insert menu.</p>

<p class="returnToSection">[ <a
href="#adding_pictures_to_your_web_page">Return to beginning of
section</a> ]</p>

<h3 id="editing_image_properties">Editing Image Properties</h3>

<p>Once you've inserted an image into your page, you can edit its
properties and customize
the layout in your page, such as the height, width, spacing, and
text alignment. If you
are not currently viewing the Image Properties dialog box, follow
these steps:</p>

<p>To edit the properties for a selected image:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Double-click the image, or select it and click the Image button
  <img src="images/image.png" width="26" height="26" alt="" /> on
  the toolbar
  to display the Image Properties dialog box.</li>

  <li>Click the Location tab to edit these properties:

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Image Location</strong>: Type the filename and
    location of the image file. Click
    Choose File to search for an image file on your hard drive
    or network.</li>
    
    <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If checked,
    &brandShortName; converts the URL to
    be relative to the page's location. This is especially
    useful if you plan to publish
    your pages on a web server so that others can view
    them. Using relative URLs allows
    you to keep all your linked files in the same place relative
    to each other, regardless
    of their location on your hard disk or a web server.
    <p>Unchecking this box causes &brandShortName; to convert the
    URL to a full (absolute) URL.
    You typically use absolute URLs when linking to images on
    other web servers
    (not stored locally on your hard disk).</p>
    <p>If you have never saved or published the page, you must first
    save the page in
    order to enable this checkbox. (This checkbox is not
    available if you open the Image
    Properties dialog box in a message compose
    window.)</p></li>

    <li><strong>Alternate Text</strong>: Enter text that will display
    in place of the original image;
    for example, a caption or a brief description of the
    image. It's a good practice to
    specify alternate text for readers who use text-only web
    browsers or who have image
    loading turned off.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Don't use alternate text</strong>: Choose this option
    if the image does not
    require alternate text or if you don't want to include
    it.</li>
    
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Dimensions tab to edit these properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Actual Size</strong>: Select this option to undo any
    changes you've made to the
    dimensions and return the image to its original size.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Custom Size</strong>: Select this option and specify
    the new height and width, in
    pixels or as a percentage. This setting doesn't affect the
    original image file,
    just the image inserted in your page.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Constrain</strong>: If you change the image size,
    it's a good idea to select this
    in order to maintain the image's aspect ratio (so that it
    doesn't appear distorted).
    If you choose this option, then you only need to
    change the height or width, but not
    both.</li>
    
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Appearance Tab to edit these properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spacing</strong>: Specify the amount of space
    surrounding the image; between the
    image and adjoining text. You can also put a solid black
    border around the image
    and specify its width in pixels. Specify zero for no
    border.</li>

    <li><strong>Align Text to Image</strong>: If you've placed your
    image next to any text, select
    an alignment icon to indicate how you want text positioned
    relative to the image.</li>

    <li><strong>Image Map</strong>: Click Remove to remove any image
    map settings.</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Link tab to edit these properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enter a web page location</strong>: If you want to
    define a link for this image,
    enter the URL of a remote or local page, or select a named
    anchor or heading from
    the drop-down list. Click Choose File to search for an
    image file on your hard
    drive or network.</li>
    
    <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If
    checked, &brandShortName; converts the URL to
    be relative to the page's location. This is especially
    useful if you plan to publish
    your pages to a web server so that others can view
    them. Using relative URLs allows
    you to keep all your linked files in the same place
    relative to each other,
    regardless of their location on your hard disk or a
    web server.
    <p>Unchecking this box causes &brandShortName; to convert the
    URL to a full (absolute) URL.
    You typically use absolute URLs when linking to
    images on other web servers (not
    stored locally on your hard disk).</p>
    <p>If you have unsaved changes, you must first save the page
    in order to enable this
    checkbox. (This checkbox is not available if you
    open the Image Properties dialog
    box in a message compose window.)</p></li>

    <li><strong>Show border around linked image</strong>: If
    checked, displays the link
    highlight color around the image.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click
  Advanced Edit to display
  the <a href="#using_the_advanced_property_editor">Advanced
  Property Editor</a>.</li>

  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>
